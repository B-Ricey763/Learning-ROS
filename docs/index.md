# Getting Started

ROS, or robot operating system, is quite confusing and daunting at first (at least it was for me). So I decided to document my experience here. Hope you Enjoy!

ROS is not necessarily an operating system, it is a repository of packages that can be used together. You have to install a [distribution](https://wiki.ros.org/Distributions) to a Unix platform, in my case, Ubuntu. Go to [ROS Setup](/rossetup) and follow the instructions to install ROS.
