Open it and choose an OS, in my case Ubuntu Server 20.04. I'm using the server distro since in the final product we won't need a desktop or an guis for that matter. Make sure to choose the 64-bit distro. Before imaging, make sure your microSD is connected to your computer. Once ubuntu is installed, put the microSD into the Pi, plug in the ethernet (or use normal WiFi ). On your first boot, connect an HDMI and keyboard (no mouse needed) to access the command line. Once you are in, run sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade to make sure everything is up to date and test your network connection. Once you see everything works, you need to set your static hostname so you don't have to connect with IP using ssh. hostnamectl set-hostname <your_hostname> # ex hostnamectl set-hostname hello_world To verify everything works, run hostname and see if the result matches your input. To connect with SSH, I configured the pi with a hostname of hyperion4516 and a default username of ubuntu . For debugging the IP of your pi, I recommend using Advanced IP Scanner . Look for an ubuntu username and copy the IP. You can use ssh ip_address to connect as as well. Using OpenSSH (on any OS, really) you can connect to the Pi with: ssh ubuntu@hyperion4516 # username@hostname It will prompt you for the password, which is hyperion4516 . You can also use PuTTY , which might actually be a better solution. It has easy configs but an ugly command line (But you can fix that). It makes gui forwarding very easy. From the SSH client connected to the server, you can then follow the installation guide for ROS Noetic . Install ros-noetic-desktop-full for all the packages you need. Make sure to properly configure and source your .bashrc file for use in ROS with these commands: echo \"source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc # It will automatically source now Also, actually follow this guide on confirming setup and making a sample workspace (that I didn't follow the first time). Each time you need to access packages in your workspace, run these commands: cd ~/catkin_ws # go to the workspace catkin_make # build the packages source devel/setup.bash # make sure the CLI knows about them I believe doing . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash does the exact same thing as the last line in the snippet above. Both add the workspace to the ROS Environment. To confirm, run echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH # the ws directory should be included Some useful ROS commands are: roscd <package> # go to package directory rosls <package> # list the subdirectories and files in package rosed <package> <file> # edit package file with Vim Once you are done with the basic setup, I would recommend running byobu to activate a window switching command line thing. It helps with ROS stuff. Some simple hotkeys are: * F2 : to create a new window * F3, F4 : To switch between active windows * Shift + F6 : To close active window Here is a cheatsheet with most of the comands.
